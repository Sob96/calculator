  connect is a facade over connectAdvanced. It turns its args into a compatible
  selectorFactory, which has the signature:

    (dispatch, options) => (nextState, nextOwnProps) => nextFinalProps
  
  connect passes its args to connectAdvanced as options, which will in turn pass them to
  selectorFactory each time a Connect component instance is instantiated or hot reloaded.

  selectorFactory returns a final props selector from its mapStateToProps,
  mapStateToPropsFactories, mapDispatchToProps, mapDispatchToPropsFactories, mergeProps,
  mergePropsFactories, and pure args.

  The resulting final props selector is called by the Connect component instance whenever
  it receives new props or store state.
 */

/*
  selectorFactory is a func that is responsible for returning the selector function used to
  compute new props from state, props, and dispatch. For example:
     export default connectAdvanced((dispatch, options) => (state, props) => ({
      thing: state.things[props.thingId],
      saveThing: fields => dispatch(actionCreators.saveThing(props.thingId, fields)),
    }))(YourComponent)
   Access to dispatch is provided to the factory so selectorFactories can bind actionCreators
  outside of their selector as an optimization. Options passed to connectAdvanced are passed to
  the selectorFactory, along with displayName and WrappedComponent, as the second argument.
   Note that selectorFactory is responsible for all caching/memoization of inbound and outbound
  props. Do not use connectAdvanced directly without memoizing results between calls to your
  selector, otherwise the Connect component will re-render on every state or props change.
